            <h3> How do I prepare for my interview? </h3>
            <p> Make sure you have all documented paystubs, proof of residency and income. Though these are not all required, the process will go a lot faster if you do have these. Sometimes, you can get approved right away. </p>
                
            <h3> How long will it take to get approved? </h3>
            <p> It's hard to say, because this can vary from case to case. But, the more clear documentation you can provide upfront, will allow you to get approved faster.  </p>
                
            <h3> Do I qualify for calfresh as a low income college student? </h3>
            <p> If you have less than $100 in your bank account, recieve financial aid, pursuing an associates or bachelors degree, and unemployed - than yes, it's probable that you qualify. </p>
